        <div class="aboutdescription"> 
        <p>In my native country of The Gambia, we begin to tell stories with the traditional Mandinka expression “Taaling, Taaling,” meaning “storytime, storytime.” Mandinka stories often incorporate wise old sayings or proverbs and I especially love deciphering proverbs from my father’s stories. Each package of Taaling Tea is paired with a proverb from my father Ansumana Kunjo’s collection of Mandinka proverbs.</p>
        <p>At Taaling Tea, we believe in a holistic approach to health that comes with tasty and nutritionally rich tea sourced in a sustainable and socially equitable way in The Gambia.</p>

        <div class="bintoudescription">
            <p>My name is Bintou Kunjo and I am a social entrepreneur blending my passion for tea, healthy living and community development. I strive to connect people to the small West African nation of the Gambia and the cultures of its inhabitants.</p>  

            <p>I live in Boston, MA but I grew up in The Gambia where all my tea is sourced. I attended Bowdoin College where I obtained a B.A. in Chemistry and a pre-medicine concentration. I drink at least one cup of tea a day, currently sipping on Gambian Mint as I write. I can often be found reading historical fiction, watching Ousmane Sembene films, exploring the outdoors or just simply laying under the sun because I find it therapeutic.</p>

            <p>I started Taaling Tea to first and foremost share a taste of The Gambia with the world through different teas, to promote healthy living and to most importantly establish Taaling Textile - a weaving art company to be based in the SeneGambian region with a great focus on youth education and employment.  </p>
